# 👥 Customer Segmentation using Clustering

## 🎯 Objectives  
- 🔢 Apply clustering (e.g., **K-Means**) on customer behavior data  
- 📊 Visualize clusters to understand different customer segments  
- 💡 Suggest marketing strategies for each identified cluster  

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries  
- 🐍 **Python**  
  - 📦 scikit-learn  
  - 📦 matplotlib
  - 
## 📂 Deliverable  
📌 A Jupyter Notebook with:  
- 📑 Data Preprocessing & Feature Selection  
- 🔢 K-Means (or other clustering algorithms) applied on dataset  
- 📊 Visualizations of customer clusters  
- 💡 Marketing insights for each cluster  

## 🚀 Steps in Task  
1. Load and preprocess customer behavior dataset  
2. Apply clustering algorithm (K-Means)  
3. Determine optimal number of clusters (Elbow Method / Silhouette Score)  
4. Visualize clusters with scatter plots  
5. Suggest strategies for each customer group  

## 📊 Example Visualizations  
- 🟢 Scatter plot of customer clusters  
- 📈 Elbow curve to find best K  
- 🔵 Distribution of features by cluster
