Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Product Reviews
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on building a Sentiment Analysis Model to classify Amazon product reviews into Positive or Negative categories.
The project demonstrates the complete pipeline:

Data preprocessing using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques
Feature extraction using TF-IDF Vectorization
Model training using Logistic Regression
Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
Develop a sentiment analysis model to classify Amazon reviews as positive or negative
Utilize NLP techniques to preprocess and analyze textual data
Train, evaluate, and deploy a machine learning model
Provide a reusable pipeline for text classification
ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
Python â€“ Programming Language
Pandas & NumPy â€“ Data Handling
NLTK â€“ Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)
Scikit-learn â€“ TF-IDF Vectorization, Logistic Regression, Evaluation metrics
Matplotlib & Seaborn â€“ Visualization
Transformers (Hugging Face) (optional, advanced) â€“ For fine-tuning pre-trained models
ðŸ“‚ Dataset
A sample dataset (amazon_reviews_sample.csv) is included with 10 Amazon reviews.
Dataset format:

review_text	rating
This product is amazing, works perfectly!	5
Terrible quality, broke after one use.	1
Labeling logic:

rating â‰¥ 4 â†’ Positive (1)
rating â‰¤ 2 â†’ Negative (0)
rating = 3 â†’ Neutral (ignored)
